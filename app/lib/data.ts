// Prefetching: loading the component in the background 
// used in nevigation

// Rendering in programming refers to the process of generating a visual representation of data

// Prerendering: Process of generation of HTMl in advance at the build time , rather than generation it on client side javascript.
// it means if the javascript disabled then component will load in the ui. this happen in the nextjs.
// it contain both the static site generation and server side rendering

// by default Nextjs prerenders the route, it means routes are rendered statically.

// Static rendering: data is fetched or component is rendered on the server at build time or when revalidating data.
// whenever user visit your application the cached result is served
 // in nextjs by default the the routes are static.
// low server load
// Better seo
// Imporved performance.

// Dynamic rendering: content is rendered on the server for each user on request time.(when user visits the page)
// During rendering, if a dynamic function or uncached data request is discovered then nextjs switch it to dynamic rendering automtically.
// Dynamic functions rely on information that can only be known at request time such as a user's cookies, current requests headers, or the URL's search params.
// Realtime data accessed
// User specific content
// Request time information.
// access information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL search parameters.
// Note: url search parameters and cookies are known only at request time.
// Note: With dynamic rendering, your application is only as fast as your slowest data fetch. thats the need of streaming.
// the component contain searchParams, request header and cookies, and dynamic function must be wrapped inside suspence
// mean streaming must be implemented for them.

// Suspence is the boundary between static and dynamic rendering
// in my words the component that is wrapped in suspence is dynamic.
